# Introduction to Machine Learning

This lecture introduces the core concepts of Learning and Machine Learning (ML), discusses the importance of ML, and explores its applications in real-world scenarios.

## Understanding Learning and Machine Learning

### What is Learning?

Learning refers to the process of acquiring knowledge, skills, or patterns from experience, observation, or instruction. In the context of machines:

- Learning involves recognizing patterns, making predictions, or improving performance over time based on data.
- For example, humans learn to differentiate between cats and dogs by observing their features. Similarly, machines can learn this task using 
        data.
