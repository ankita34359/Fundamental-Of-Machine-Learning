# Introduction to Machine Learning

This lecture introduces the core concepts of Learning and Machine Learning (ML), discusses the importance of ML, and explores its applications in real-world scenarios.

## Understanding Learning and Machine Learning

### What is Learning?

Learning refers to the process of acquiring knowledge, skills, or patterns from experience, observation, or instruction. In the context of machines:

- Learning involves recognizing patterns, making predictions, or improving performance over time based on data.
- For example, humans learn to differentiate between cats and dogs by observing their features. Similarly, machines can learn this task using 
        data.

## What is Machine Learning (ML)?

Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on:

- Learning patterns from data.
- Making predictions or decisions based on those patterns.
  
#### Key Definition:

Machine Learning is the study of algorithms and statistical models that enable machines to improve their performance on a specific task using data and experience.

## How  Machine Learning Works

**Input Data:** The machine takes structured or unstructured data as input.

**Training:** It uses algorithms to learn patterns from this data.

**Prediction/Output:** The machine predicts outcomes or classifies new data.

**Feedback:** The machine improves its model based on errors and feedback.

## Example of Machine Learning in Action

Email Spam Detection:

Input: Emails (data).

Training: Analyze emails labeled as "spam" or "not spam."

Prediction: Classify new emails as "spam" or "not spam."
